# ubuntu-desktop-bootstrap

I'm setting this up because I often reinstall Ubuntu Desktop or try out new flavors

A fresh install of Ubuntu is missing many of the packages that we have come to expect.

To streamline the process, start with the most basic tools available and expand from there:

* `bash`
* `apt-get` or `aptitude`
